                History
                </h2>

                <h3>Founding (950 ASE)</h3>
                <p> 
                The land of Varlesia has changed hands and had boundaries moved countless 
                times throughout history. Rulership has been passed between elves, and 
                dwarves, and orcs - and even previously humans, but Varlesia as we know it 
                was only founded after the land was wrest from the grip of the Adal Elves. 
                </p>

                <h3>Under Queen Adalia (950 - 987 ASE)</h3>
                <p>
                During her time as Queen of Varlesia, Adalia was known as "Adalia the Seer". 
                It was said that she held many mystic conclaves with wise men and woman across 
                the realms, who she sought to aid her govern this new land. 
                </p>

                <h3>Under Queen Larah (987 - 1023 ASE)</h3>
                <p>
                Requires further research.
                </p>

                <h3>Under King Graveth (1023-1023 ASE)</h3>
                <p>
                King Graveth held the throne of Varlesia for a total of 12 days. His reign was 
                short, but was accepted by the people, though his coronation was a rushed affair. 
                An event that often lasts days spanned only 38 minutes. It is thought that his 
                advisors were aware of the threat that his elder, bastard brother Amavet posed to 
                his crown, and so they attempted to put Graveth in power, then hide him away. 
                As you will no-doubt tell by now, they failed.</p> <p>Graveth the Unfortunate, as 
                he is now known, was rushed from Capital and taken to as discrete monastery, 
                just on the edge of the river Felder, at the foot of the Myriad Mountains. He 
                went disguised and accompanied by only a handful of guards. All those were 
                clad in plain clothes, without sigil or sign to show their affiliation. They 
                had guessed that they would avoid Amavet with this element of subterfuge - and 
                they were correct! What they didn't count on was the criminal element.</p> <p>While 
                King Graveth technically reigned for 12 days, he spent 9 of those days in the 
                hands of his captors - a band of villains known as the Copper Company. They struck 
                the monastery in what appeared to be a raid unrelated to the King's presence, but 
                they took his guards by surprise. It is told that the King's guards fought 
                valiantly, but were eventually overwhelmed, and slain. The King, being a mere 12 
                years of age, put up much less of a fight. However, the Company seems to fracture 
                at this point - half of the remaining number taking off back into the Beowode, 
                while the others remained in the monastery. This schism still remains a mystery, 
                though what is clear, is that the activity at the monastery drew the attention of 
                Amavet quite quickly.</p> <p>Some have speculated that Amavet had connections to 
                the Copper Company, which led him to so quickly find the hiding place of the
                 King, and resulted in such lack of bloodshed on this occasion - as when he 
                 arrived, Amavet found his brother chained to the central pillar of the monastery. 
                 Not one for pleasantries, Amavet slew him where he lay and collected "what he was 
                 due" - the crown of Varlesia.</p> <p>The site where King Graveth met his end is now 
                 where the church in the town of Gravesford was established - the name of the town 
                 a reference to this ill-fated monarch.</p>

                <h3>Under King Amavet (1023 - 1028 ASE)</h3>
                <p>
                As the bastard son of Queen Larah and her lover, Tville de Norefort, Amavet felt 
                slighted at being ignored as the next ruler when his mother passed away. He was the 
                eldest child of Larah, he argued -- Further research needed.
                </p>

                <h3>Under King Omund (1028 - 1053 ASE)</h3>
                <p>
                Further research needed.
                </p>

                <h3>Under Saint Manfred (1053 ASE - Current)</h3>
                <p>
                Those present on the day Manfred slew Omund have remained tight-lipped on many 
                details, but there are some facts that have filtered through the populace - though 
                Manfred and his allies would surely claim these as falsehoods. It is said he laughed. 
                Manfred laughed as his crushed the former King's windpipe with his gauntleted fist. 
                He laughed as he sank his blade through the former King's heart. He laughed, as he 
                cast Omund's broken corpse down at the feet of his men, who wept at the sight of their 
                destroyed monarch.
